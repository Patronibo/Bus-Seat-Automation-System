   seats (full/empty) is presented with a graphical interface.
 * Reservation System : Users can quickly reserve and cancel the seats they choose. For each reservation
   process, a confirmation message is displayed to the user and the transactions are record
 * Database Integration : The project stores seat information and reservation status using MYSQL database.
   This allows users to update data in real time.
 * User Friendly Interface : The application is designed using Java Swing. A simple and understandabler
   user interface allows users to perform their operations quickly and easily.

Technologies :
 * Java : The application was developed using the Java programming language. This ensures portability
   and platform independence.
 * Swing : Java Swing library is used to develop user interface. This library  is very effective for creating
   graphical user interface (GUI) elements.
 * MySQL : MySQL is used for database management. All seat and reservation information is stored in this
   database.
 * Maven : Apache Maven is used for project management and dependency management. This makes it easy to
   compile and manage the project.
